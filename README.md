## üõ† Git Workflow (Best Practices)

To ensure a clean, traceable, and collaborative repository, all team members must follow these standardized Git workflow practices.

### 1. Branch Naming Convention (Frontend & Backend)

All branch names must clearly identify the **Type**, the **Scope** (where the change is happening), and a short, descriptive name.

The format is: `<type>/<scope>/<description>` (Use hyphens or underscores for spaces)

| Main Task Type | Prefix | Scope Options | Description | Example Branch Name |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Feature** | `feature/` | `frontend/` or `backend/` | For adding new user-facing functionality. | `feature/frontend/user-profile-ui` |
| **Bug Fix** | `fix/` | `frontend/` or `backend/` | For fixing a bug or unexpected behavior. | `fix/backend/auth-endpoint-bug` |
| **Technical** | `tech/` | `frontend/` or `backend/` | For non-functional changes (refactoring, optimizing, etc.). | `tech/frontend/optimize-image-loading` |
| **Setup** | `setup/` | `infra/` or `deps/` | For configuration, dependencies, or environment changes. | `setup/backend/add-flyway-migration` |

### 2. Standard Workflow Steps 

#### **Step A: Start & Update**

```bash
# 1. Check Current Status
git status

# 2. Update Local Main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

#### **Step B: Create & Work**

```bash
# 3. Create a New Branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name 
```

#### Step C: Commit Changes

```bash
# 4. Stage & Commit Changes (Use the Conventional Commit Format: Main task(scope): short description)
git add .
git commit -m "feature(frontend): create login UI" 
# Example: git commit -m "fix(backend): correct inventory deduction logic"
```

#### **Step D: Push & Submit**

```bash
# 5. Push Branch to GitHub
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

# 6. Open Pull Request (PR) on GitHub
# PRs must be reviewed and approved before merging into main.
```

#### **Step E: Sync & Cleanup (After Merge)**

```bash
# 7. Sync After Merge
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 8. Clean Up Old Branches (Optional but Recommended)
git branch -d feature/your-feature-name               # Delete locally
git push origin --delete feature/your-feature-name    # Delete on GitHub
```
