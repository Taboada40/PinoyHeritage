## üõ† Git Workflow (Best Practices)

To ensure a clean, traceable, and collaborative repository, all team members must follow these standardized Git workflow practices.

### 1. Branch Naming Convention

Use the following three-part naming structure: `<Main Task Type>/<Module>/<short_description>`

| Main Task Type | Prefix | Description | Example Branch Name |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Feature** | `feature/` | For adding new user-facing functionality. | `feature/user-accounts/create_profile_page` |
| **Bug Fix** | `fix/` | For fixing a bug or unexpected behavior. | `fix/login/color_of_the_button` |
| **Technical** | `tech/` | For non-functional changes (e.g., refactoring, optimizing). | `tech/login/change_validation_library` |
| **Setup** | `setup/` | For configuration, dependencies, or environment changes. | `setup/login/add_authentication_library` |

### 2. Standard Workflow Steps

#### **Step A: Start & Update**

```bash
# 1. Check Current Status
git status

# 2. Update Local Main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 3. Create a New Branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name 

# 4. Stage & Commit Changes
git add .
git commit -m "feature(login): create login UI" 
# Example: git commit -m "tech(homepage): improve image loading"

# 5. Push Branch to GitHub
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

# 6. Open Pull Request (PR) on GitHub
# PRs must be reviewed and approved before merging into main.

# 7. Sync After Merge
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 8. Clean Up Old Branches (Optional but Recommended)
git branch -d feature/your-feature-name               # Delete locally
git push origin --delete feature/your-feature-name    # Delete on GitHub
